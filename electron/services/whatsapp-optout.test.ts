/*
 * WhatsApp direct-send opt-out guard (defense in depth).
 *
 * Bulk campaigns already filter whatsapp_enabled=1 in SQL; this pins the
 * SECOND layer: a direct sendMessage naming a family must refuse when that
 * family opted out of WhatsApp messages. The guard runs BEFORE any session
 * or network work, so the disabled case needs no socket: it throws the
 * opt-out message while an opted-in family gets past it (and only then hits
 * the "WhatsApp is not connected" guidance).
