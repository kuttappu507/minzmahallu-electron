/**
 * Next register number for official registers (marriages / deaths / welfare).

 * The old scheme was `'PREFIX-' || year || printf('%03d', COUNT(*)+1)` scoped
 * to rows dated in the current year. That breaks in two ways:
 *   1. A record dated outside the current year (e.g. a late-registered 2025
 *      marriage) is invisible to the COUNT, so the NEXT registration reuses /
 *      lags behind a number — the register then shows e.g. numbers up to 009
 *      while the count and the dashboard card correctly say 10 records.
 *   2. Deleting the highest record (deaths) makes the same number reusable.
 * This helper instead takes the MAX trailing number across ALL rows of the
 * table (any prefix format) and adds 1, guaranteeing a strictly increasing,
 * collision-free series. A final existence loop guards mixed-format data.
